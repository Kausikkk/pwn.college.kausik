# Challenge 1 learning from documentation

The typical need you'll have for documentation is just to figure out how to use all these
dang programs, and a specific case of that is figuring out what arguments to specify on 
the command line. This module will mostly dig into that concept, as a proxy for figuring 
out how to use the programs in general. Through the rest of the module, you'll go through
various ways of asking the environment for help for the programs, but first, we'll dig into
the concept of reading documentation.

The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, on the proper specification of 
arguments to them. Recall the -a of ls -a in the hidden files challenge of the Basic
Commands module: that -a was an argument that told ls to list out hidden files as well as 
non-hidden files. Because we wanted to list out hidden files, invoking ls with the -a 
argument was the correct way to use it in our scenario.

## Solution 
1. This challenge was about learning to find the correct arguments for a program by reading its documentation
2. The goal was to find the right argument to pass to the `/challenge/challenge` program to make it give me the flag.
3. ased on this direct instruction, I constructed the final command and got the flag

```sh
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{o4J7zx2ExD8Uh3EhEFoGWinX0MQ.QX0ITO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

## Flag

```
pwn.college{o4J7zx2ExD8Uh3EhEFoGWinX0MQ.QX0ITO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes
1. The instructions gave me the exact answer, which was to add the --giveflag argument to the command.
2. This is what I learnt.

# Challenge 2 Learning complex usage 

While using most commands is straightforward, the usage of some commands can get quite complex. For example, the arguments to commands like sed and awk, which we're definitely not getting into right now, are entire programs in an esoteric programming language! Somewhere on the spectrum between cd and awk are commands that take arguments to their arguments...

This sounds crazy, but you've already encountered this with the find level in Basic Commands. find has a -name argument, and the -name argument itself takes an argument specifying the name to search for. Many other commands are analogous.

## Solution 

1.This challenge introduced the concept that some arguments, like `--printfile`, require their own arguments.
2. The goal was to run the `/challenge/challenge` program with the correct arguments to print the flag.
3. The documentation explained that I needed to use the `--printfile argument`.
4. So i constructed the following code to get the flag

```sh
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
```

## Flag

```
pwn.college{AuJZp0OIFi3UGzXjxr-trVeFvbm.QX1IT00wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes 

1. I learned to think of commands as being built from three parts, the program I'm running, the action I want it to take , and the target of that action.
2. This puzzle showed how important it is to combine new and old information.

# Challenge 3 Reading Manuals

This level introduces the man command. man is short for manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument. For example, let's say we wanted to learn about the yes command (yes, this is a real command):

```sh
hacker@dojo:~$ man yes
```

This will display the manual page for yes, which will look something like this:

```sh
YES(1)                           User Commands                          YES(1)

NAME
       yes - output a string repeatedly until killed

SYNOPSIS
       yes [STRING]...
       yes OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Repeatedly output a line with all specified STRING(s), or 'y'.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

NAME
	This gives the name (and short description) of the command or
	concept discussed by the page.

SYNOPSIS
	This gives a short usage synopsis. These synopses have a standard

	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] SINGLE_MANDATORY_ARGUMENT
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS...

DESCRIPTION
	Details of the command or concept, with detailed descriptions

```
You can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn. When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit q to quit.

Manpages are stored in a centralized database. If you're curious, this database lives in the /usr/share/man directory, but you never need to interact with it directly: you just query it using the man command. The arguments to the man command aren't file paths, but just the names of the entries themselves (e.g., you run man yes to look up the yes manpage, rather than man /usr/bin/yes, which would be the actual path to the yes program but would result in man displaying garbage).

## Solution 

1. This challenge introduced the man command, the built-in manual for Linux commands
2. I opened the manual for the program by running man challenge.
3. I carefully read the description section, looking for a way to get the flag. I found an option listed as --wrrepn NUM, which the manual said would print the flag if NUM is 619.
4. I exitted the manual by pressing q and then ran the program to get the flag.

```sh
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --wrrepn 619
```

## Flag

```
pwn.college{Mwrr6CX1eGp-OnUKVZdd9uz9eaz.QX0EDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes

1. I learned how to use the  `man` command.
2. I also learned how to quit a man page which is by just pressing the q key and the most important information is usually in the synopsis and description sections.
3. I faced a problem while quitting the page, it took me a while.

# Challenge 4 Searching manuals 

You can scroll man pages with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with /. After searching, you can hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result. Instead of /, you can use ? to search backwards!

## Solution 

1. First as the challenge said I entered the man challenge manual by press `man challenge` command.
2. this took some time to search.
3. I used the `/flag` to search for the words faster and pressed n to go to the next sentence which has the word flag.
4. At last while scrolling using up and down arrows I found the flag command `--wmvvp` command.
5. Finally I executed the command and retrived the flag.

```sh
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --wmvvp
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{Y2Iaq1WpGI4sNz5QFrsbTMhgAwV.QX1EDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

## Flag

```
pwn.college{Y2Iaq1WpGI4sNz5QFrsbTMhgAwV.QX1EDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes 

1. At first I didnt understand were to find the flag.
2. On opening the manual and spending some time searching I found the command.
3. This showed me that we need to have a bit of patience.

# Challenge 5 Searching for manuals 

This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name. Luckily, all of the manpages are gathered in a searchable database, so you'll be able to search the man page database to find the hidden challenge man page! To figure out how to search for the right manpage, read the man page manpage by doing: man man!

## Solution 

1. This puzzle's instruction manual had a hidden, random name.
2. First, I ran man man to learn how to search for manuals and found the -k option.
3. Next, I used man -k challenge to find the hidden manual's real name, which was elmtkdpmvn.
4. Then, I read the hidden manual with man elmtkdpmvn and discovered the secret option was --elmtkd 098.
5. Finally, I used that secret option with the program to get the flag.

```sh
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man man
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man -k challenge
elmtkdpmvn (1)       - print the flag!
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man elmtkdpmvn
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --elmtkd 098
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{QelmU0BF9tM80QQkdBpm0vnCk-f.QX2EDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

## Flag 

```
pwn.college{QelmU0BF9tM80QQkdBpm0vnCk-f.QX2EDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes 

1.trick I learned is that you can read the manual for the man command itself by typing man man.
2.The most important new tool from this lesson was man -k, which lets you search for a manual page by a keyword.

# Challenge 6 Helpful Programs 

Some programs don't have a man page, but might tell you how to run them if invoked with a special argument. Usually, this argument is --help, but it can often be -h or, in rare cases, -?, help, or other esoteric values like /? (though that latter is more frequently encountered on Windows).

## Solution

1.This puzzle required finding the right arguments to get the flag.
2.I first ran /challenge/challenge --help to read the program's instructions.
3.The help message showed a -p option to get a "secret value," and a -g option that needed that value to give the flag.
3.So, I first ran the program with -p to get the secret value, which was 474.
4.Then, I ran the program again with -g 474 to get the flag.

```sh
hacker@man~helpful-programs:~$ /challenge/challenge --help
usage: a challenge to make you ask for help [-h] [--fortune] [-v] [-g GIVE_THE_FLAG] [-p]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --fortune             read your fortune
  -v, --version         get the version number
  -g GIVE_THE_FLAG, --give-the-flag GIVE_THE_FLAG
                        get the flag, if given the correct value
  -p, --print-value     print the value that will cause the -g option to give you the flag
hacker@man~helpful-programs:~$ /challenge/challenge -p
The secret value is: 474
hacker@man~helpful-programs:~$ /challenge/challenge -g 474
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{4wDHrjrx7VekqnvgE4RtmyTv3iw.QX3IDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

## Flag 

```
pwn.college{4wDHrjrx7VekqnvgE4RtmyTv3iw.QX3IDO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes 

1. The main lesson was that many programs have a built-in instruction manual that you can see by using the --help argument.
2.I learned to read the help text carefully, as the solution was a two-step puzzle hidden in the list of options.

# Challenge 7 Help for builtins 

Some commands, rather than being programs with man pages and help options, are built into the shell itself. These are called builtins. Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs. You can get a list of shell builtins by running the builtin help, as so:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ help
```
You can get help on a specific one by passing it to the help builtin. Let's look at a builtin that we've already used earlier, cd!
```sh
hacker@dojo:~$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
...
```

## Solution 

1.This challenge taught me to use the help command to get instructions for shell "builtin" commands.
2.I ran 'help challenge' to see how this level's command worked.
3.The help text showed that I needed to use the --secret option.
4.The instructions also gave me the secret value to use, which was `Y4n0Z0KB`.
5.I ran the command with the correct option and value to get the flag.

```sh
hacker@man~help-for-builtins:~$ help challenge
challenge: challenge [--fortune] [--version] [--secret SECRET]
    This builtin command will read you the flag, given the right arguments!
    
    Options:
      --fortune		display a fortune
      --version		display the version
      --secret VALUE	prints the flag, if VALUE is correct

    You must be sure to provide the right value to --secret. That value
    is "Y4nOZ0KB".
hacker@man~help-for-builtins:~$ challenge --secret Y4nOZ0KB
Correct! Here is your flag!
```

## Flag 

```
pwn.college{Y4nOZ0KBXaZEEBq2XyBM-PBLIk9.QX0ETO0wCMzAzNzEzW}
```

### Notes 

1.I learned that some commands like cd are not separate programs, but are "builtins" that are a part of the shell itself.
2.The help command is the special instruction manual used specifically for these builtin commands.
3.This lesson completed my knowledge of how to get help: man for normal programs, --help for programs without a manual, and help for builtins.
